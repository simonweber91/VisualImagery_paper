function parallel_pool(n_workers, restart, rng_shuffle)

% function parallel_pool(n_workers, restart, rng_shuffle)
%
% Initializes parallel worker pool, with the option to restart an already
% exististing pool and to shuffle the random number generator on each
% worker individually.
%
% Input:
%   - n_workers: Number of workers that will be created.
%   - restart: Set to 'restart' to re-initialize the pool if it is already running.
%   - rng_shuffle: Shuffles the random number generator for each worker
%       individually, helpful for e.g. simulations.
