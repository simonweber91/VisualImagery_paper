% Hi there!
%
% This is the complete pipeline to recreate the analysis and plots in
% "Working memory and imagery in early visual cortex" by Weber,
% Christophel, GÃ¶rgen, Soch and Haynes. To create the figures from the
% paper, just complete a few file paths below (look for '...') and then hit
% run (ignore the warning messages). If you have the original data (which
% can be made available upon reasonable request), you can also recreate the
% entire analysis. This might take very (very!) long, so computing clusters
% and parallelisation are key (look for the out-commented 'parfor' and
% 'parallel_pool' lines in the various functions).
%
% In this file, a bunch of analysis parameters are specified and stored in
% a structure 'p' (for 'parameters'), which is passed to all other
% functions along the way. The parameters used for the published analysis
% are the ones you see below. All subsequent functions are commented
% fairly thoroughly, so I hope everything becomes clear with minimal (or at
% least medium) effort. In case it doesn't, or you have questions, feel
% free to email me at sweber@bccn-berlin.de.
%
% There are a few external tools and toolboxes that are required to run the
% analysis. These are listed below, including their respective download
% links. Make sure that you all resources are available on your system and
% added to the Matlab search path.
%
% Cheers!
